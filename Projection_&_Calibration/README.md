# MQP - Lung Ultrasound 3D Projection Mapping and Body Segmentation

## Purpose Statement

This project is separated into two parts; DensePose and RealSense.
From there in DensePose, there is the body detection and segmentation done in the past project
In the RealSense section there are 5 separate sub-sections. These are as follows:

1. Calibration_Procedure - Holds the procedure to calibrate the Camera Projector system
2. Projection_Rendering - Implementation of the 3D projection mapping/rendering in the calibrated system
3. Archive - Extra code that was used for reference or past code
4. Realsense CAD - The stls for the camera mount that was printed.

The ArUCo Detection, Visualize Point Cloud, Realsense Test folders hold all of the work that went into the Calibration Procedure. The OpenGL Test folder is for all of the work that went into the projection and rendering component of the project.
