# MQP - Lung Ultrasound 3D Projection Mapping and Body Segmentation

## Purpose Statement

This project is separated into two parts; DensePose and RealSense.
From there in DensePose, there is the body detection and segmentation done in the past project
In the RealSense section there are 5 separate sub-sections. These are as follows:

1. ArUCo Detection - Holds all of the work done for the ArUCo detection end of the project.
2. Calibration Procedure - Holds the procedure to calibrate the Camera Projector system
3. OpenGL Test - Tests for a working instance of OpenGL within python
4. Realsense Test - Tests for a working python instance of the Realsense SDK
5. Visualize Point Cloud - Tests for determining the viability of "cropping" the pointcloud of the Realsense

The ArUCo Detection, Visualize Point Cloud, Realsense Test folders hold all of the work that went into the Calibration Procedure. THe OpenGL Test folder is for al of the work that went into the projection and rendering component of the project.
