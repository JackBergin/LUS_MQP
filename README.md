# MQP2
##I. Evaluation of Hardware
     Within this project several things had to be tested in order for the procedure of calibration to be implemented. The first test run in this project was to test the viability of the hardware. From the previous MQP it was already known that the RealSense camera would be the best option for the depth and location readings for the projector. The untested hardware in this case, was the projector so a few tests were run in order to test its viability. When beginning this project, the distance of the projector to the patient was not known. A test was run in which the projector was turned on and then moved to a wall to properly size the pane that it was projecting. This was done to test and find the distance that would cover an individual's sternum while allowing for movement of the patient. The test determined that 1 meter was the distance best suited for the projector. The projector was then tested in varying cases of light to determine the best lighting for visibility and sharpness of image.

Table 1. Testing Environment Constraints of AnyBeam Projector

     From the test results run above, it was determined that the optimal testing environment for the projector would be a dim lit room. This would allow for the operators to view the room as well as make sense of what is being projected on the patient. Experiments run on the hardware proved a few things. The first was that this was a viable option for projection mapping in a dim to light room. It was also confirmed that the needed height for the projector is 1 meter for the patient which can interface into virtually any operating room which would be equipped with this device. 


##II. Difficulties with Setup and Compatibility
     The setup for RealSense was different from that of the setup for the previous group. Not only was the camera set up on different hardware, but on a different operating system while also being run through virtual machines. The work instructions for the RealSense SDK and ROS wrappers were for Ubuntu 18.04 where, in this case, 20.04 was being used. Due to this debugging and updates to the installation instructions were required, namely with the server permissions Intel included to download the package containing all of the RealSense libraries needed. Once the SDK and the library was fully set up, a test was run to see if the camera was working. RealSense View was used in this case (and executed through terminal) allowing for the user to see the depth sensor and motion capturing of the RealSense. A problem that was quickly found, however, was with Viewer being run once, exited, and then not being able to boot again without having to hard reset the camera (plug and unplug). Upon first look at the problem, signs pointed to the cable, hardware itself, or some form of ROS incompatibility but after scrupulous testing, it was determined the problem was due to the virtual machine, Parallels. This machine in its settings requires the user to grant it permissions to use USB devices connected to the local machine. Due to this, a reset for the RealSense camera was integrated into the code in order for the code to work on a repeatable basis. Once learning more about Parallels, permissions were granted for it to have full access to the camera upon plugin with the local machine. 

     It was next the hope that DensePose could be set up on the machine in order to get the old pipeline of the MQP working. Once this was working, implementation of the projection mapping to the DensePose output could then be focused on. This, however, posed yet another problem. Upon trying to get the code for DensePose working, it was realized that the repository implemented CUDA. “CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model created by NVIDIA” [18]. As of a couple years ago, CUDA was able to be run on different GPUs not just specific to NVIDIA. This was then changed by Apple and due to this the existing code would not be able to work on the current computer being used so access to the WPI GPU cluster was gained. From there, a pipeline is being created in which one can be on their native OS while being able to operate CUDA from the external GPUs. Success for this method is uncertain which is why, in another solution, a separate computer was acquired granting the ability to run CUDA through an NVIDIA GPU.This computer was set up with an Ubuntu 20.22 LTS operating system and will be used to run the calibration, densePose, and projection procedure going forward.

     One of the biggest struggles within this project thus far has been with the CMAKE dependencies within C. The libraries that people have made required some very difficult setup and it required a lot of debugging to do so. In order to keep track of the things I debugged and fixed, I delegated an entire notebook towards debugging and brainstorming for this project. A recent roadblock for this project was in regards to the AprilTag detection. In C, the dependencies to get this working with the Realsense camera was incredibly difficult. To fix this problem sooner rather than later, the repository being kept on this project along with all of the code was switched over to python. This also would make the densePose to Realsense pipeline practically seamless because it can be run off of the same general program. 

##III. Projection Mapping Research
     While the DensePose integration side of things was put on hold, the preliminary research into the projector was pursued. In this time, several platforms were considered for the calibration, rendering, and graphics end of things for the projector. The first two platforms that were considered were Blender  and Unreal Engine. Both Blender and Unreal Engine had heavy graphics abilities and the ability to live render on different use cases of projection and special effects (such as Extended Reality walls for Unreal Engine). Upon inspection of Blender, it was found that it would be valuable to use because the software already is prepared to do most of the rendering for the 3D projection mapping. Eevee (a third party software extended from Blender) would be the extension used to live render the experience. When looking into Unreal Engine, it was quickly found that integration of its coordinates to the projector and RealSense would cause much more work to be done. It was also found that with Unreal, the extension into 3D projection mapping is headed by a 3rd party that had little to no documentation. The live rendering for Unreal Engine also takes a lot of computing power (depending on the size of experience). Since the size of experience in this case is relatively small eg. constrained to the patient's chest, there would be relatively little difficulty in being able to render this but there would most likely be general lag due to the hardware we have access to to live render with.

     Once the pipeline from either Unreal Engine or Blender to the projector and camera was created, the next thing considered was experience design. There would be a need to design/create the work instructions and other projected experiences for the Unreal Engine or Blender experience. To do this, the software that would be utilized is Creo Illustrate paired with a CAD modeling software or Unity. The pipeline would look as follows:

![Screen Shot 2022-07-09 at 6 02 36 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81708456/178124029-c3410576-1c6a-47a4-8ae5-ff320e0117b1.png)


Figure 4. Flowchart depicting the pipeline of the preliminary 3D projection mapping pipeline.

     In this case CAD or Unity software would create the static design of the work instruction. Then this would be animated in Creo Illustrate. From there Unreal or Blender could be used to put this design in reference to the projector and then render the design based on the changes in location of the patient. All together this pipeline was solid in concept but incredibly complex. It followed a similar pipeline for the development of AR experiences through wearable or holdable electronics. The belief was that utilizing a process similar to the Hololens would work because the Hololens acts as 2 smaller projectors for each eye. This belief, however, leads to much more complex problems. After attempting the pipeline focus was changed to simplifying the pipeline. 

     A new solution for the projection mapping, OpenGL, was found rather quickly. Upon researching two existing projects that utilized projection mapping and live rendering, it was mentioned that OpenGL was used as their graphics and rendering software [25][11]. While it did not have the graphic prowess of Unreal Engine and Blender, it was much simpler to use, especially for calibration purposes. OpenGL is both a cross-platform and language API that is utilized for rendering 2D and 3D graphics [19]. Upon implementation of OpenGL with an initial test script, the potential of the software was realized and the two previous leads; Unreal Engine and Blender were archived.

![Screen Shot 2022-07-09 at 6 02 49 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81708456/178124032-11582f07-4cde-4f02-86b6-4066763de554.png)

Figure 5. Initial test script's execution of OpenGL using a translation to center its red point coordinates to match with the RealSense Viewer (0,0) point based on Viewer's single depth reading. The vantage point of this image is from the RealSense Viewer box.

##IV. Progress with OpenGL and RealSense
     Once the test scripts for OpenGL and RealSense were working in parallel, they were then combined in order to create a preliminary calibration test for the RealSense and OpenGL. Upon activating RealSense View and OpenGL simultaneously, the offset of the RealSense camera and projector was adjusted and then eliminated. A correlation between pixel frame and RealSense frame was created. Since depth was the next step to account for, the projector, while streaming on RealSense View and OpenGL, was moved closer and farther from the wall. What was found with this test was that the centered point would move on a linear y=x path off from its adjusted offset. To fix this, it was decided that an updating variable was integrated into the x,y coordinate of the projector to account for the 3D axis and the projected center point was able to stay centered. This then uncovered a problem. The way OpenGL works is by accessing a blocking loop for its graphics. Efforts are still going towards this to fix this blocking problem and create code that can “render'' its projection. The next step within this test would be the inclusion of point specific depths and their prospective projections. Currently the camera is reading only one depth which is its origin point’s Zed axis. By including several more points and different depths then the calibration of the system can be done. It should be noted that there was a GitHub repository created holding all of the code for this along with documentation on the code’s inner workings and the how-to to set it up [5]. 

##V. Initial Calibration Tests
     The first calibration test done within the project was done while testing the Hardware of the projector in different lighting and distances. A checkerboard that matched the 1280p x 720p [10] of the projector was then projected and RealSense Viewer was used to see the offset of the projector's center and the camera's center. 

![Image7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81708456/178124036-dedf3ef9-c0d4-4a64-9fd5-eb971774af8f.png)


Figure 6. The Centered view of the Projector is the red dot overlapping the two center squares on the checkerboard. The RealSense view is down and to the left from the projector's center in the -(x,y) coordinate region.

     Once learning of this offset, it was applied to a point in OpenGL and Figure 7 and Figure 8 were created. This was done in order to test the impact of depth of the projected image and to see what transforms would be needed in order to calibrate the system. 

![1%20foot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81708456/178124042-70397460-3baf-45ce-be3d-7cfa6cc5ad93.png)

![1%20meter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81708456/178124046-1cfd9c1a-e3a1-48a0-ab6c-a40e03603616.png)


Figures 7 & 8 (From left to right). Figure 7 is the centered view of the OpenGL and RealSense at a depth of 1 meter. Figure 8 is the Centered view of the OpenGL and RealSense at a depth of 1 foot. As one can see the distortion of this change in depth has a linear correlation down the black line in the above image.

This calibration testing was only for when the projector was at a set distance of 1 meter. Through implementing the static calibration, the result in figure 9 was achieved.

<img width="854" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-29 at 2 46 23 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81708456/178124050-f1b6ba3a-e459-4db0-b525-dd74d9a8e0c7.png">


Figure 9. The checkerboard now has all of the dots calibrated to each of the 1 inch squares using the static transforms derived from Figures 7 and 8. This acts as the Xp to Xm transformation as shown below in Figure 10 for more clarity behind the math model [23].

VI. Calibration Ideation and System Transforms
     The first implementation of the calibration relies on three transforms within the system. The first transform is from the RealSense to the projector, the second is from the RealSense to the workspace and the third is from the projector to the workspace [23]. This system was derived from a previous project concerned with 3D projection mapping. The concept is to have an 8x5 checkerboard (with squares 1 inch by 1 inch) 1 meter from the wall. At the center of each of the checker’s vertices is  a point to be overlaid with the projector [23]. From there, various points will be mapped to this checkerboard in which the three transforms above are applied [28]. The transform from the wall to the realsense is known, and from the RealSense to the projector. The transform from the projector to the wall must be calculated in order to properly match the location of the RealSense. 

![Cam_cal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81708456/178124058-498e0a32-2f4f-436b-9e1a-52a3be0c6ecc.png)

Figure 10. The above image is of the checkerboard calibration along with the frames being utilized within the calibration. Crgb is the frame of the camera, P is the frame of the projector, and M represents the model space of the calibration [23]. 

     To calculate the transform from the image above, however, the process described within the paper overcomplicates the problem. Through utilizing several points on the checkerboard and then the points that correspond to these on the RealSense (including all 3 axises of measure) translations of the projected image can be done in order to correct for warping on the projector. More testing must be done to validate this claim.

     The current method shown above utilizes the pinhole method for camera calibration. In this, the labeled Realsense camera will use the transforms associated with the pinhole method to achieve the proper localization in the work space. From there, a reverse pinhole method can be done for the projector and again, the transforms will be localized to the workspace thus allowing for the camera and the projector to be calibrated with one another. 

![Screen Shot 2022-07-09 at 6 04 56 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81708456/178124068-1dd1a753-2e16-46fa-9a22-c6e8664e2bd9.png)


Figure 11. The above image was my personal breakdown of the math showcased in source 9 of the bibliography along with the logic and visualization of the frames.

     For a better explanation of the system at hand, it is easier to isolate the camera itself and then apply the same logic to that of the projector. What we are left with is the following transforms and their corresponding model as seen below.

![Screen Shot 2022-07-09 at 6 05 34 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81708456/178124081-5daf92ec-3b06-46e6-92ef-041cff320aa2.png)

Figure 12. The above image is the illustration and math behind the pinhole model. This will allow for the camera to be put in reference to the world frame and the same will be done for the projector thus calibrating the system [6] [27].

     The primary thing for this methodology that I personally did not like was the required need for a checkerboard for each calibration. This made little sense to me since we had a depth sensing camera and a projector. With this in mind, the calibration technique that will be pursued in place of the pinhole method (albeit, similar) utilizes the Realsense’s point cloud function along with the projection/detection of apriltags to calibrate the system. The following figure attempts to explain this methodology through illustration.

![Screen Shot 2022-07-09 at 6 06 00 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81708456/178124086-5f53f749-6fb2-44bd-98ca-c71bf77f4d58.png)

Figure 13. Initial ideation of using calibration with the Realsense and projector through a different methodology. 

     The thought process behind this was the following; the frame of the projector will fit in the frame of the Realsense camera. The Realsense camera has a point cloud that is formatted in the form of a list. If we were to “crop” the point cloud of the Realsense to the area of the projector (using the Realsense AprilTag detection function) then the system will be calibrated. To test if cropping the point cloud would work, the following graphs were created with pylibplot in order to visualize what cropping would do to the point clouds.

<img width="713" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-29 at 2 50 08 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81708456/178124090-14324388-242d-4669-9489-d3aa82c945d2.png">

Figure 14-17 (Left to Right, Top to Bottom). Figure 14 is of the entire point cloud from the Realsense camera (which is comprised of over 250,000 points). Figure 15 was created to better understand the 3D point cloud which represents the entire Realsense view in 2D. Figure 16 was then created as a test to see if a section of this point cloud could be cut out like in Figure 13’s methodology. Figure 17 is when Figure 16 is then returned back to its 3D state. All of the units above (for Figures 14-17) are in regards to meters. 

     To properly visualize the point cloud being collected by the Realsense, I 3D plotted it all. Next I made it 2D, taking away the depth component to better visualize the X, Y axises. From there, I cropped a desired area from the 2D point cloud graph, and then, once cropped, added the depth component back into the graph. The axises in all of the graphs above are in meters. The importance of including the point cloud in this camera calibration is that now, knowing depth, we can warp the projection for the 3D projection mapping effect. 

##VII. AprilTag Detection
     In order to properly crop the point cloud, a form of border detection of the projector would be required. For this, it was believed that AprilTags would be the best fit. “AprilTags are a visual fiducial system, useful for a wide variety of tasks including augmented reality, robotics, and camera calibration” [2]. Sadly, this portion of the project was where progress was halted due to the utilization of some C libraries within the Realsense code. Initially, to test the output of the AprilTag detection a simulation was run.

![Screen Shot 2022-07-09 at 6 06 38 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81708456/178124093-f7a1529e-0d86-4115-92fa-eb3d5635765e.png)

Figure 18. Simulation showcasing the pose estimation of the AprilTags in varying positions and angles. Next will be to project these in imperfect conditions and then achieve pose estimations for them.

     Once this was completed, the next step was to integrate this development within the Realsense code that was already working. In an attempt to get the libraries functioning, about two weeks were set aside. After diving deep into debugging the library, it was found that the problem was within the “make” command located within the “CMakeList.txt” file. Once this was corrected, the library was able to run but the detection of the AprilTag was still not a success. After closer examination of the code it was found that the hardware and software being utilized was not compatible with one another (for the Realsense code library to work, it was contingent on the Realsense camera being in the T series rather than in the D series which is what we are currently using). It was then decided by the MQP advisor and TAs that it would be better if the C code was converted to python and that ArUCo markers were utilized over the AprilTags due to simplicity’s sake. ArUCo markers are similar to that of AprilTags, acting as binary fiduciary markers, however they take full utilization of the OpenCV library which integrates very well into the python pipeline as well [3]. 

##VIII. ArUCo Marker Detection
     In order for an ArUCo marker to be detected, the first step was importing the image from the Realsense into OpenCV in a grayscale format. From there, the ArUCo marker being used in the image would have to match the ArUCo dictionary within OpenCV. In this case, we are using “aruco.DICT_6X6_250”. Once it was confirmed that the markers being used were within this dictionary, the command “aruco.detectMarkers” was executed. Once this command was completed I was able to extrapolate all of the necessary points and data from the detected marker. To better understand the mathematics behind the ArUCo marker detection, the following flow chart provides a high-level overview of the methodologies.

![Screen Shot 2022-07-09 at 6 07 00 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81708456/178124100-d82d2134-f8a8-4d01-846c-153db7c7ef81.png)


Figure 19. The above represents the closed feedback loop of the OpenCV ArUCo detection algorithm being deployed within this MQP project [12].

     Camera frame is the image being used with OpenCV. The “Adaptive threshold” is the dictionary of ArUCo markers being used [12]. From there, the OpenCV detection algorithm will be utilized for “Square detection” [12]. This process is one in which training and validation datasets from the OpenCV library are used in conjunction with the test image of the marker itself. Once the “Square detection” portion is completed, the OpenCV algorithm will then continue further “Marker validation” by cross referencing all of the detected squares with the desired ArUCo dictionary [12]. If there are no valid ArUCo markers, this process will begin again at the “Adaptive threshold” part. If successful, “Pose Estimation” will ensue.

     For the “Pose Estimation” process, the function “aruco.detectMarkers” was utilized. This function works by taking the image with the detected bounding box (with it also being a verified marker) and then places points in the order of bottom-left, top-left, top-right, and bottom-right on the detected marker [4]. For input the detection function takes an input image, the ArUCo dictionary (which indicates the type of markers that will be searched for), and an empty array to store the corners vector of detected marker corners [4]. “For each marker, its four corners are provided, (e.g std::vector<std::vector<cv::Point2f> > ). For N detected markers, the dimensions of this array is Nx4” [4]. As for output of this function, the corner arry is the only output we are interested in. As said above, the output is four points at each corner of the marker starting in the bottom-left and then going clockwise. It is important to note that these four points are in a 2D pixel coordinate system. 

     After further investigation of the ArUCo marker code, it was found that ArUCo marker detection is able to work based on either an input of images from a video stream [12]. This application of video stream brings the possibility of multithreading. By multithreading with the video stream for ArUCo marker detection, I mean there is now the possibility for the process of live rendering and live calibration to run in parallel so that the subject will always be focused on by the system and the projection remains in a high quality and high accuracy state. Returning back to the testing of this ArUCo detection method, the following image was created in order for the markers to be identified and then located within the 2D coordinate system of the image. Within this image are the detection boxes to visually showcase the code picking up on each of the markers.

![Screen Shot 2022-07-09 at 6 07 23 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81708456/178124110-4457b42f-ace6-4ab8-9cb7-25b03366027b.png)


Figure 20. First ArUCo marker detection test done with an image that has 4 markers at each of its bounds. This image was created in a size of 1280p x 720p to fill the projector screen [10].

     Prior to this test being validated, I created a similar image as in Figure 20 but not registered with the ArUCo marker library I was using at the time. This led me to debug my program for a couple of days but this test was important to determine the visibility of these markers being projected. The Realsense Viewer app was utilized for this and the following image showcases the results.

![Screen Shot 2022-07-09 at 6 07 42 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81708456/178124116-613c7100-ac0d-43b2-9461-e72d14832cfb.png)

Figure 21. This is the first view of the Realsense and ArUCo markers to determine if the projector is bright enough for the ArUCo code to detect the markers.

     The concern here was to prove if the markers were visible enough to be detected with the ArUCo marker code. Upon its test (but with the Figure 20 image in place of the Figure 21 image), it was found that this image was not adequate enough for the ArUCo markers to be identified. From there, work was done to look at how the Realsense captures images. The color capture through the Realsense looked to have a gray scaling effect and after testing this image with the ArUCo marker code, the image below was the result.

![Screen Shot 2022-07-09 at 6 08 05 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81708456/178124123-7090377c-066a-4fdf-8fe9-193bb38038e7.png)


Figure 22. The first successful detection of the ArUCo markers with the projector and Realsense working together in order to calibrate the system.

     These tests proved the ArUCo marker detection capabilities but now there was a need to understand the output of these marker’s data. To do this, the data was collected and then graphed so that the coordinates of the system can be understood. The following image is of the ArUCo markers being graphed in the colored points and the estimated frame of the ArUCo markers in the black points.
 
![Screen Shot 2022-07-09 at 6 08 33 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81708456/178124129-f3d28c63-1dd9-478e-93fc-f25b6350c035.png)

Figure 23. Workspace of the projector from the ArUCo markers (multi-colored points) coupled with the estimated workspace within the Realsense camera (black points).

     The “estimated” frame points were derived from projecting the above image and then launching the Realsense Viewer app. From there, the points were recorded and graphed alongside the ArUCo marker points. This was done not only to understand the ArUCo marker data but also to see how these points would correspond with the Realsense points. As seen above the ArUCo markers coordinate system and the Realsense coordinate system correspond directly. After completing all of the necessary tests for the ArUCo markers, the next step was to convert the OpenGL code utilized within the C code portion of this project to python. After installing one library, “pyopengl”, OpenGL was running perfectly on the python end of things and it was already in non-blocking form in regards to code integration for the projection mapping graphics and densePose detection. 

IX. Calibration Input & Output
     The methodology for calibration in this project is very similar to the illustration in Figure 13, with the only difference being the ArUCo markers are now in the place of the QR markers. The input for this calibration is a color image from the Realsense camera capturing the projected ArUCo markers that bound the workspace of the projector and of the subject we will eventually be using this for. Output from this process will be the 2D pixel coordinates of the ArUCo markers which correspond to the 2D pixel coordinates of the realsense.

![Screen Shot 2022-07-09 at 6 09 14 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81708456/178124152-7461eda3-3582-4a29-a250-b39adcceeb3f.png)

Figure 24. The following image is of the output from the ArUCo marker detection.

     After this output is received, it will be converted with the Realsense SDK to 3D world coordinates (in order to correspond with the point cloud) to act as input for the cropping of the point cloud generated from the Realsense. Once the cropping of the point cloud is completed, we will be left with a point cloud covering the entirety of the workspace providing X, Y, and Zedd coordinates as an output. From there projection mapping of work instruction can take place using this point cloud space as the necessary input for live rendering and graphic manipulation.

	It should also be noted that each iteration of the calibration will have these results making them very easy to reproduce. The above tests were run several times in order to see the reliability of the readings. When the camera and projector are moved, there will be an adjustment in these results in the depth frame but the X and Y bounds will stay consistent as long as the projector and camera are kept untouched. As soon as the projector and Realsense camera are moved, calibration must be run again. This is due to the work space for the camera and the workspace for the projector not being properly aligned from the previous calibration. If one were to continue with the uncalibrated system there will be discrepancies in the projection’s accuracy as well as the 3D projection mapping effect. 

##X. Static Projection Mapping Test
     In order for the static projection mapping test to take place, there needed to be a conversion from the ArUCo marker 2D image coordinates to the 3D coordinate system of the Realsense. Even though testing showed that the Realsense coordinate system and ArUCo marker coordinate system corresponded with one another, the point cloud generated from the Realsense operated in the realm of meters rather than 2D image coordinates. Due to this, the 2D pixel coordinate system to 3D workspace coordinate system conversion took place with the Realsense SDK.
##XI. Densepose Integration Pipeline
     Currently, the steps to integrate Densepose into the camera projector system are undergoing. As progress is being made with the projection mapping side of the project, progress on the Densepose algorithm end has also been taking place. Kechiev Brimbraw is currently implementing revisions into the algorithm that will improve upon its reliability of mapping to a patient. The pipeline will require the live data from the DensePose algorithm to be injected into the current projection mapping process of the projector. This creates a general pipeline of RealSense to DensePose code, and then DensePose code to the projection mapping code, and from there to the projector. It should be noted that the DensePose code and the projection mapping code will be running together and updating to live render the work instructions or results of the LUS on the patient. Due to the code being changed from C to Python, the ease of combining the densePose and Realsense pose has increased drastically. The original plan was to utilize ROS in the C Realsense script along with ROS in the densePose Python script for the cropped pointcloud to be transmitted between the two. Since both of these functions are now in the same language, it’s now just a matter of combining the scripts for them to work in a non-blocking manner.
