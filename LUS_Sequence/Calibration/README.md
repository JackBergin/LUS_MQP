# Calibration Procedure for LUS
## Purpose
The purpose of this section within the repository is to hold the entirety of the calibration sequence. This application will take the ArUCo markers, segment them in the projectiors field of view and then get the borders and point cloud as the return value. Once these are acieved they are exported to a separate text file where they can be parsed.
The following figure is the result from one of our early tests. The calibration sequence takes a color live stream from the projectior camera system and then can be run until a desired calibration result is achieved. ![Screen Shot 2022-07-09 at 3 36 09 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81708456/178142925-6901c766-35f1-44a2-9f4d-43ae55ccce24.png)
